# CS:1210 Computer Science 1: Fundamentals (Spring 2023)
**Instructor:** Sriram Pemmaraju, University of Iowa

## Course Overview
This repository contains coursework and projects for Computer Science 1: Fundamentals at the University of Iowa. The course covers developing precise problem specifications, algorithm design and analysis, reasoning about algorithm correctness and efficiency, and translating algorithms into Python code. Topics include basic programming concepts (variables, expressions, control flow), data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries), algorithm analysis and efficiency, file I/O, user interaction, divide-and-conquer techniques, searching and sorting algorithms, and recursive functions.

## Projects 
In addition to coding homeworks (which are not listed in this repository as they are very minimal), this course contained two projects written in python.

- [Google Earth Visualization](google_earth_visualization/README.md)
- [Movie Rating Algorithm](movie_rating_algorithm/README.md)
